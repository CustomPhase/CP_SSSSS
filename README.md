<h3>Tested only in Unity 5.4.2, works with deferred/forward, gamma/linear, HDR/LDR, DX11/DX9, perspective/ortho.</h3>

<h1>How to use:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Put the files into any folder in your Assets/CP_SSSSS folder</li>
<li>Attach the CP_SSSSS_Main script to your main camera</li>
<li>Attach CP_SSSSS_Object script to any Renderer object that you want to have subsurface scattering on</li>
</ol>

<h1>Basic idea behind algorithm:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Blur the source image separably, based on the distance from the camera, and attenuate surrounding sample's influence based on the depth difference between this sample and the center sample (Soft Depth Bias parameter controls the maximum depth difference allowed)</li>
<li>Render the scene with replaced shader, using the mask set in CP_SSSSS_Object script multiplied by the subsurface color</li>
<li>Composite the blurred stuff on top of the original, multiplying it by mask from step 2, and substracting the original based on the Affect Direct parameter</li>
</ol>
